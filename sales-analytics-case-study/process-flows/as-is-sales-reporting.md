3. **Version Control**: Conflicting reports from different sources
4. **Limited Accessibility**: Reports only available to email recipients

### Business Impact

2. **Resource Drain**: Skilled staff spending time on manual tasks
3. **Inconsistent Insights**: Different interpretations of same data

## Stakeholder Feedback

### Sales Leadership
> "By the time we see the numbers, the quarter is half over. We need real-time visibility to make timely decisions."

### Sales Operations
> "We spend more time fighting with spreadsheets than analyzing performance. The process is broken."

### Regional Managers
> "I can't see how my team is performing until the end of the week. By then, it's too late to course-correct."

## Improvement Opportunities
1. **Automate Data Integration**: Eliminate manual data extraction and consolidation
2. **Standardize Metrics**: Establish single source of truth for calculations
3. **Enable Self-Service**: Provide direct access to data for stakeholders
4. **Real-time Updates**: Move from weekly to continuous reporting
