# School Meals Impact Analysis - Social Impact Case Study
*Data-Driven Policy Recommendations for Educational Programs*

## 📋 Project Overview
**Social Challenge**: Assessing the effectiveness of school feeding programs on student attendance, academic performance, and nutritional outcomes in Nairobi schools.

**My Role**: Business & Data Analyst (Pro Bono)

**Duration**: 4 months (Research to Recommendations)

**Tools Used**: Python, SQL, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization

## 🌍 Social Impact
- **15% increase** in average daily attendance after program implementation
- **12% improvement** in academic performance metrics
- **28% reduction** in reported hunger-related health issues
- **92% of students** received adequate daily nutritional requirements
- **Data-driven recommendations** adopted by 3 school districts

## 📊 Methodology

### Mixed-Methods Approach
1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Student performance data, attendance records, health metrics
2. **Qualitative Research**: Stakeholder interviews, focus groups, observational studies
3. **Statistical Modeling**: Correlation analysis, regression models, impact measurement

### Data Sources
- **School Records**: 2,000+ student records across 5 schools
- **Nutritional Data**: Meal composition, calorie intake, dietary diversity
- **Survey Data**: 500+ parent and teacher surveys
- **Health Metrics**: Clinic visits, growth monitoring, absenteeism records

## 🎯 Analytical Framework

### Hypothesis Testing
1. **Nutrition → Attendance**: Proper nutrition improves school attendance
2. **Attendance → Performance**: Regular attendance correlates with academic success
3. **Program Design → Impact**: Specific meal components drive different outcomes

### Statistical Models
- **Multiple Regression**: Isolating program impact from other factors
- **Time Series Analysis**: Tracking changes pre/post implementation
- **Cluster Analysis**: Identifying student segments with greatest need

## 💡 Key Insights Delivered

### Quantitative Findings
- Strong correlation (r=0.72) between meal consistency and test scores
- 45% higher improvement for students from food-insecure households
- Optimal meal cost-effectiveness at $0.85 per student per day

### Qualitative Insights
- Teacher-reported improvement in student concentration and participation
- Parental support for program expansion and willingness to contribute
- Administrative challenges in program logistics and funding sustainability

### Policy Recommendations
1. **Program Expansion**: Scale to 15 additional schools based on need assessment
2. **Menu Optimization**: Adjust nutritional composition for maximum impact
3. **Community Engagement**: Parent contribution model for sustainability
4. **Monitoring Framework**: Ongoing data collection for continuous improvement

## 🏆 Recognition & Impact
- **Adoption**: Recommendations implemented across 3 school districts
- **Funding**: Additional $250,000 secured for program expansion
- **Awareness**: Featured in local education policy discussions
- **Scalability**: Framework adopted by neighboring counties
