- Regression models controlling for external factors
- Effect size calculations using Cohen's d

### Baseline Establishment

#### Pre-Intervention Baseline (3 months)
| KPI | Baseline Value | Data Collection Method |
|-----|----------------|----------------------|
| Attendance Rate | 82% | School records analysis |
| Test Scores | 58% average | Standardized assessments |
| BMI z-scores | -1.2 average | Clinic measurements |

## Appendix

### KPI Calculation Examples


#### Cost per Meal Calculation
Total monthly cost: $2,000
Students served: 250
Meals per month: 20 days × 250 students = 5,000 meals
Cost per meal = $2,000 / 5,000 = $0.40

### Data Collection Templates
- Standardized assessment forms
- Survey instruments
- Observation checklists
- Financial tracking sheets
  
#### Attendance Rate Calculation
Total school days in month: 20
Student A present: 18 days
Attendance rate = (18 / 20) × 100 = 90%
